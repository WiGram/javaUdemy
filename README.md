# Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers

This is the content from a course taught by Tim Buchalka. As mentioned in the page description, the aim is to be sufficiently proficient in Java programming to follow another course in algorithms and data structures taught at Coursera.com by professors as Princeton.

The aim of learning algorithms and data structures is purely curiousity led. My formal education is in economics with a graduate degree that was slightly quantitatively finance oriented, with the most demanding course combining continuous time finance with C++. Consequently, I have learnt some programming, using functions and data types, simulation etc., but would like a deeper understanding of efficient programming.

Hopefully, this course together with Algorithms will eventually get me there. It will be a long road, and I hope to reach the end of it by the end of 2020.
